- apple signup sandbox user 사용하는 법
	- https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/121940
		1) create sandbox user in App Store Connect
		2) go to icloud.com to accept the "Terms & Conditions"
		3) create a local account on your Mac (or if you have a spare phone, you can probably do step 4 via the phone) and use that sandbox ID when asked about the Apple ID.
		4) from your local account, on the Mac, configure 2FA (turn it on) in : System Preferences -> Apple ID -> Password & Security (use a valid phone number to receive text messages)
		5) go back to your regular account and, from Xcode, start the simulator and configure the Apple ID as that sanbox user's ID. The 2FA setting should show that it's turned on.
